# tables.phoebe-project.org

Flask web-server to serve passband and atmosphere tables compatible with PHOEBE 2.2+.  As long as you have a stable internet connection, PHOEBE will query and pull tables on-the-fly as necessary.  Alternatively, you can call phoebe.download_passband or use the web form at [phoebe-project.org/tables](http://phoebe-project.org/tables) to download tables in advance.
* For tables compatible with PHOEBE 1.x (legacy), see [phoebe-project.org/1.0](http://phoebe-project.org/1.0/download)
* For tables compatible with PHOEBE 2.0.x and PHOEBE 2.1.x, see [phoebe2-tables](https://github.com/phoebe-project/phoebe2-tables) instead.
